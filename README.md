### Continued development

I want to focus more on writing javascript codes, writing functions and doing more of object oriented programming.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for understanding css flexbox and grid. his website is very explanatory and good for learning web development.
- [Traversy Media](Traversy Media on YouTube) - This is an amazing channel which helped me understand almost everything I know about html, css and javascript. I recommend it to anyone learning to become a fullstack developer.
